What is SanYanSe
===============
([http://sanyanse.org/](http://sanyanse.org/))

SanYanSe is a competitive 3-coloring solver 'framework'.  All colorers implement Callable and essentially compete to find the solution first.



------------------------------------

### Who

SanYanSe is the result of a coloring competition, obsession over minutia and performance, and great discussions with Ravi Bhide.

Primary author: Brian Guarraci
Contributor/team mate: Ravi Bhide

### Surprise

A lot of great ideas and algorithms fell on their sword during this effort.
Many great ideas of my own and discussions with Ravi resulted in failed attempts to dethrone
the BacktrackColor.

My current theory is that this algorithm is small enough to fit on the CPU cache, so it just kicks ass.
